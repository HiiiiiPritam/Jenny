1) change the chatInterfece in th zustand store

2) there is isImage option even for teh user chats so maybe we can use this to check if this message was ment for an image \

3) Right now i am not able to redirect the user to the direct chat page as the chat is not set to anything as i am calling the fetchUserChat from the store in the normal flow
